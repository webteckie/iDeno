# Visual Studio Code
Make sure to close all your Visual Studio Code windows after installing Deno so that the install path is picked up. If the extensions below still complain that
they cannot find Deno in the Path then just set the path manually and restart VS Code.

Extensions:

    - Deno
    - deno-vscode

Optional:

    - TypeScript Extension Pack

# Your Project

- Create your Project
- Run command 'deno init'
- Create a 'src' folder for your source files

You are ready to go!

# Running Code
To run your code, simply open a Terminal window to your project and:

    deno run .\src\<your-module>
